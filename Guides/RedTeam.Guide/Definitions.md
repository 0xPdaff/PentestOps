## Allow List

### Definition

An **Allow List** is a curated list of approved and permitted entities such as users, IP addresses, email addresses, or applications. It specifies what is allowed to access certain systems, applications, or networks, helping to enhance security by preventing unauthorized access.

Allow Lists are commonly used in security settings to explicitly grant access, in contrast to a **Deny List**, which specifies items that are blocked or disallowed.

### Key Points
- An allow list includes entities explicitly granted permission to interact with or access systems.
- This technique is used to enhance security by limiting access to trusted entities.
- Commonly implemented for:
  - Email addresses (to prevent spam)
  - IP addresses (for network security)
  - Applications (to allow trusted apps to run)

### Example Use Cases

1. **Email Security**:
   - An email service provider uses an allow list to specify email addresses or domains from which it accepts messages, helping prevent phishing and spam attacks.

2. **Network Access**:
   - A firewall can use an allow list to restrict network access to only specific trusted IP addresses, improving security and minimizing unauthorized access.

3. **Application Security**:
   - In enterprise environments, allow lists are often used to ensure that only authorized applications can run on devices, preventing malware or unapproved software from being executed.

### Comparison with Deny List

- **Allow List**: Grants explicit permission to specified entities.
- **Deny List**: Explicitly blocks or restricts specified entities.

The allow list approach provides a proactive security stance, where the system trusts only those entities on the list, minimizing the risk of threats from untrusted or unknown sources.
