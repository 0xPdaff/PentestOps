# Definitions

This lexicon is a starting point to help define terms commonly used in red teaming. Clearly defined terms are critical for communications and essential for security professionals.

## Allow-list
An allow-list is a list of things considered trustworthy or good. An allow-list is used to grant access to defined resources. This list is often associated with controlling traffic through firewall rules or controlling allowed applications by creating a list of authorized software. Allow-listing enforces the deny-all by default approach to security.

## Assumed Breach
The Assumed Breach Model assumes a threat has some level of access to a target at the initiation of the engagement. This model saves time and money by focusing on higher impact goals.

## Blue Cell
The blue cell is the opposite side of red. It includes all the components defending a target network, typically composed of blue team members, defenders, internal staff, and an organization’s management.

## Blue Team
A security team that defends against threats.

## Command and Control (C2)
Command and Control (C2) is the influence an attacker has over a compromised computer system that they control.

### Command and Control Tiers

- **Interactive**: Used for general commands, enumeration, scanning, data exfiltration, etc. This tier has the most interaction and is at the greatest risk of exposure.
- **Short Haul**: Used as a backup to reestablish interactive sessions. Involves slow callback times.
- **Long Haul**: Same as Short Haul but with even slower callback times (24+ hours).

## Control Cell (a.k.a White Cell)
Serves as referee between Red Team activities and defender responses during an engagement. Monitors adherence to the Rules of Engagement (ROE).

## Deny-list
A deny-list is a list of things considered untrustworthy or bad. It restricts access to defined resources, often using firewall rules or prohibited software lists.

## Engagement / Exercise Control Group (ECG)
The group responsible for all activities conducted during the engagement, including senior managers, IT members, a White Cell, and a Red Team liaison.

## Exfiltration
Exfiltration is the extraction of information from a target, typically through a covert channel.

## Get In, Stay In, Act
The three main phases of a Red Team engagement:

- **Get In**: Gain access to a network.
- **Stay In**: Establish persistence or a permanent presence.
- **Act**: Perform operational impacts against a target.

## IOC (Indicator of Compromise)
Artifacts that identify or describe threat actions.

## OPFOR
An Opposing Force (OPFOR), commonly associated with military war-gaming scenarios, represents the enemy force.

## OPLOG (Operator Log)
Logs generated by Red Team operators during an engagement, with required fields that must be captured.

## Operational Impact
The effect of a goal-driven action within a target environment.

## OPSEC (Operational Security)
A process to minimize exposure of critical information to adversaries.

## Out Brief, Executive
A post-engagement meeting tailored to management, usually performed within one or two days following execution.

## Out Brief, Technical
A technical exchange of information between the Red Team, the Blue Team, and the organization. It offers a detailed review of actions and results.

## Penetration Testing
A test methodology intended to circumvent the security function of a system, often with specific constraints. It focuses on reducing the attack surface by identifying and mitigating findings.

## Persistence
The ability or techniques used to establish a permanent presence during the engagement.

## Prepositioning
Using access and capabilities gained during an engagement to best position an operator for impact.

## Red Cell
The components that make up the offensive portion of a Red Team engagement. This group simulates strategic and tactical responses of a target.

## Red Team
An independent group that emulates a threat to challenge an organization’s security effectiveness.

## Red Teaming
The process of using Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to emulate real-world threats, aiming to train and measure the effectiveness of people, processes, and technology.

## Red Team Lead
The operational and administrative leader of the Red Team, responsible for engagement oversight and adherence to laws, regulations, policies, and the Rules of Engagement.

## Red Team Operator
The operational executor of the engagement, responsible for applying Red Team TTPs and keeping logs during the engagement.

## Rules of Engagement (ROE)
Guidelines and responsibilities for the Red Team, customer, system owner, and stakeholders during the engagement.

## Situational Awareness
A step in a Red Team engagement that gathers information on targets to determine next actions towards privilege escalation, lateral movement, or other steps.

## Threat
An expression of intention to inflict evil, injury, or damage.

## Threat Emulation
The process of mimicking the TTPs of a specific threat.

## Threat Intelligence
Information that provides context for decision-making regarding threats.

## Threat Model
A process by which potential threats or the absence of appropriate safeguards are identified, enumerated, and mitigated.

## Threat Perspective
A threat's initial point of view, used to build and shape a threat profile or scenario.

## Threat Profile
Establishes the rules for how a Red Team will act and operate during an engagement.

## Threat Scenario
Provides insight into how a defensive solution will perform, focusing on real-world security operations.

## Tradecraft
The techniques and procedures of espionage, often used interchangeably with TTPs.

## Trusted Agent (TA)
A person with privileged knowledge of engagement activities, responsible for preventing irreversible damage or risk.

## TTPs
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, sometimes called Tools, Techniques, and Procedures.

## Two-Person Integrity (TPI)
A process that ensures two team members verify actions during the engagement, reducing risks.

## Vulnerability Assessment
A systematic examination of an information system to determine the adequacy of security measures.

## Web Shell
A piece of web code that allows an adversary to use a web server as a gateway into a network.
