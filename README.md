# Welcome to 0xPdaff's Pentesting Repository

This repository is dedicated to penetration testing (pentest) and aims to provide tools, guides, playbooks, and original developments for every phase of a pentest. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced pentester, you'll find valuable resources to help you enhance your testing process.
